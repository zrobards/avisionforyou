## 💰 What You Can Now Say

- "We handle Stripe integration for nonprofits"
- "We've built systems serving 500+ users"
- "We work with 501(c)(3) organizations regularly"

### **On Your Site:**
- Homepage hero: "We've built platforms for recovery centers and mental health organizations"
- Projects page: Real case study with screenshots
- Services page: "This is a live donation page we built" (with proof)

### **In Proposals:**

## 🚀 Deploy Priority: **HIGH**

**Why?** 
- AVFY launches Dec 20 (7 days from now)
- You want portfolio updated BEFORE launch
- Once AVFY is live, you can link to it directly
- This proves you're building real systems, not demos

**Timeline:**
- Today: Add screenshots + deploy
- Dec 20: AVFY goes live → add live site link
- Dec 21: Share on LinkedIn/social media
- Jan 1: Add metrics and testimonial

## ❓ FAQ

### **"What if AVFY isn't running locally?"**
- Use the screenshots from your browser (the ones you showed me)
- They're already saved in your Cursor assets folder
- Just need to copy them to `public/`

### **"Do I need to change any code?"**
- Nope! All code is done.
- Just add the 4 image files.

### **"What if images don't show up?"**
- Check filenames exactly: `avfy-home.png` (lowercase)
- Make sure they're in `public/` not `public/logos/`
- Clear browser cache

### **"Can I deploy without screenshots?"**
- Technically yes, but pages will have broken images
- Better to add them first (takes 5 minutes)
