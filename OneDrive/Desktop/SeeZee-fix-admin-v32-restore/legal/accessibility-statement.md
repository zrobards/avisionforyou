**Last updated: December 13, 2024**

SeeZee Studio is committed to digital accessibility and inclusion. We believe technology should work for everyone.

## Why Accessibility Matters to Us

Accessibility isn't just a checklist for us — it's our foundation. We design websites for people with memory challenges, processing differences, anxiety, sensory sensitivities, and other cognitive needs.

We build with empathy first, because we believe the internet should include everyone.

Accessibility is an ongoing process. We regularly review and improve our site as technologies and standards evolve.
